Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Purpose: Recognize menstrual products despite shape distortion.
Training: Use diverse datasets with images of menstrual products in various states (crumpled, partially visible, etc.).
Pre-trained models: Leverage pre-trained models like ResNet, EfficientNet, or YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection, and fine-tune them with a specialized dataset for waste, focusing on menstrual products.
b. Semantic Segmentation
Purpose: Segment waste images into different material categories, distinguishing menstrual products from other materials.
Model: Models like U-Net or Mask R-CNN can segment regions of the image that likely correspond to menstrual waste.
Application: Instead of relying solely on object detection, this method can help segment out specific textures or regions (e.g., absorbent materials, packaging).
c. Multi-Class Classification
Purpose: Differentiate menstrual waste from other types of waste (e.g., cotton clothes, plastic wrappers) based on features like patterns, textures, and subtle material differences.
Model: A multi-class classification model can be used, where one of the classes is menstrual waste, and others include cotton materials, plastic, and other categories.
Techniques: Use texture and material feature extraction to improve classification accuracy. Models like DenseNet are good at learning subtle details and differences in material types.
2. Material and Texture Analysis
To address the similarity in materials (e.g., cotton, plastic) between menstrual products and other waste, an AI model can focus on material properties.

a. Hyperspectral Imaging and Analysis
Purpose: Detect differences in the chemical composition of waste items, such as polymers in plastic parts of menstrual products or absorbent materials in pads.
Model: Use Spectral Classification models like Random Forest or SVM (Support Vector Machines) trained on hyperspectral data to identify chemical signatures unique to menstrual products.
b. Texture Classification Models
Purpose: Differentiate between cotton used in menstrual pads and similar cotton materials using texture patterns.
Model: Local Binary Patterns (LBP) or Gabor filters can help extract texture features, which can be further classified by SVMs or CNNs.
Application: Menstrual pads have specific patterns due to their design, and subtle differences in textures can be used to classify these products.
